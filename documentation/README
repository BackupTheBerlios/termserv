The documentation is written in docbook format. In order to build it,
you need (among others) the packages

docbook
docbook-stylesheets
cygnus-stylesheets

Documentation is available in the packages

docbook-doc
docbook-stylesheets-doc

Note that these are the names of the Debian pacakges, they may vary for
other distributions.
Another good resource is the KDE Documentation Editor's Homepage at
http://i18n.kde.org/doc/index.html.



Translation:

The master source of the documentation is in English (not yet
fully translated from German, because we started with German only).
Currently the only other language available is German.
If you want to translate the documentation into another language
(for example french), just do this:

cd userguide/src/
cp userguide.en.sgml userguide.fr.sgml

and begin to translate. You probably also want to change the line

<book lang="en">

to

<book lang="fr">

inside the document.
The build system automatically recognises the
new language and builds it. Note that the language code ("fr" here)
is standardized by the norm ISO 639, so you can't just invent one.

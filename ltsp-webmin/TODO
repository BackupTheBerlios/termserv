0.6:

 - handle new LTS_ROOT (/opt/ltsp/i386)

 - add support for Etherboot ROM image creation

0.7:

 - add support for local printers and perhaps touch pads

 - add support for automatic dhcp update

no particular version:
 - handle 8bit chars (for example umlauts) in the translated files
   correctly, that means don't display "ü" but "&uuml;". This should
   be a function of webmin.
 - resolve the problem with the same string to be translated twice (or more),
   for example "N" means "None" in PRINTER_0_PARITY and "No" somewhere else.
   Idea: When looking up the translation first search for the value prepended
   with the option name (here "PRINTER_0_PARITY_N"), and only if that fails,
   look for the value (here "N"). Then we should translate "PRINTER_0_PARITY_N"
   to "None" and "N" to "No". This is not elegant, but should work.
 - Handle multiple occurences of the same option like PRINTER_0_TYPE ..
   PRINTER_2_TYPE more intelligently, that means without having to specify
   each options seperately.
 - Improve the UI. That means, display some options only if some others are
   set / not set. Example: If XF86CONFIG_FILE is set, display none of
   the X options.
   Problem: We need something like an "Update" button or a solution with
   javascript.
 - write script that checks wether all possible values of translated options
   are in the language files.

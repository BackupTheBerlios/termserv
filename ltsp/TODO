This is an unsorted TODO list for the LTSP Debian packages.
Some items might not be debian specific, but apply to all distros.
The fact that something is contained in this file does not necessaryly mean
that it gets implemented. Also, the order of things is _not_ sorted in any way.
Think of this file as of a collection of thoughts that might be useful.

get rid of the ldconfig calls in postinst scripts
(they mix server and ltsp tree)

add a shutdown entry to {k,g,x}dm menu. Requested by many people,
  but how to do it?

copyright in ltsp-doc: where is the gfdl installed in debian?
  Not installed at all in the moment:-(
  What is the copyright of the other texts (besides the LTSP manual)?

clean up kdm configuration

make background (display of LTSP logo) work again for kdm (and maybe other dm too?)

add Ken Yaps changes from ltsp-devel for rejecting 2nd dhcp server by dhclient

install rgb.txt also in /etc/X11?

install xkbcomp also in /usr/X11R6/bin?

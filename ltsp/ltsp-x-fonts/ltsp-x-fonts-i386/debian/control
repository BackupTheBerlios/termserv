Description: X fonts for the Linux Terminal Server Project (ltsp.org)
 This package contains fonts for runnig X on an LTSP workstation.
 This package is not needed if you have a font server on your network.
 However, some font servers become unreliable if used by more than
 a few dozen clients. If this is the case you can use this package
 instead of the font server.

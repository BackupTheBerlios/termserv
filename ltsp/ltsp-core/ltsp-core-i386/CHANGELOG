Jul 20, 2002 LTSP 3.0.5 -jam-

   ltsp_core

     o Integrated a patch from Eric Harrison to fix the XOPTS
       problem with the Xvesa Xserver for the ThinkNic.


May 9, 2002 LTSP 3.0.4 -jam-

   ltsp_core

     o Integrated the changes supplied by Georg Baum for
       Debian to support DHCP v3.0


May 6, 2002 LTSP 3.0.3 -jam-

   ltsp_core

     o Added support for Suse 8.0


May 5, 2002 LTSP 3.0.2 -jam-

   ltsp_core

     o Added support for Redhat 7.3, Mandrake 8.2 and Suse 7.2 and 7.3 

     o Fixed problem with ltsp_initialize for Suse. COPY templates were
       opening the target for input, rather than output, and 'interpreter'
       was overwriting the default answer, causing "/bin/sh" to appear in the
       default column.

     o Modified rc.local to work properly if ltsp_x_core package is
       not installed.

     o Fixed problem in the gdm_Init template.  It seems that readlink
       doesn't exist on all distros, so I simulated it with perl.


Dec 17, 2001 LTSP 3.0.1 -jam-

  ALL

     o RPM packages created

  ltsp_x_core

     o Updated vidlist file supports more video cards, including
       many cards that require XFree86 3.3.6

Nov 28, 2001 LTSP 3.0.0 -jam-

  ltsp_core

     o Renamed the package to be 'ltsp_core' instead of 'lts_core'.

     o Added a new config entry for lts.conf.  DISABLE_ACCESS_CONTROL
       In previous versions of LTSP, access control was disabled on the
       workstations, meaning that any client process could display windows
       on the workstation.  This has been changed, to leave access
       control enabled.  If you want to run programs on other servers,
       then you can use the xhost command to add each additional server
       to the list of allowed servers.  If you want to disable the access
       control, to allow any programs to display on the workstation, then
       set this option to 'Y'.  CAUTION, this can create a security problem,
       because any user can run a program that displays on any users desktop.

     o Modified getltscfg to also match on IP address and MAC address of
       the workstation.  Thanks to Bjorn Helgaas for the patch.

  ltsp_x_core

     o Merged in Robbie Stanfords touch screen code into rc.setupx



Nov 25, 2001 LTSP 2.09pre5 -georg-

  lts_core

     o Fixed install.sh and debian.sh to work with the current
       unstable and upcoming Debian 3.0 release.

     o Fixed debian.sh to work with kdm 2.2 and all nfs-server variants.

     o Changed the kernelname in the section of debian.sh that creates
       dhcpd.conf.example to vmlinuz-2.4.9-ltsp-4 so that it matches the
       kernel name in the kernelpackage.

     o Fixed a typo in descr.txt: s/inetd.conf_tftpd/inetd_tftpd/

     o Added description for wdm-config to descr.txt

     o Updated porting_guide.txt

Oct 29, 2001 LTSP 2.09pre4 -jam-

  lts_core

     o Automatically load the agpgart module when an i810
       chipset is auto-detected, or specified in lts.conf.

     o Added support for Linux Progress Patch (LPP)

     o Added entry to vidlist for IGS CyberPro 2010 

     o Fixed problem with gdm-change.pl.  This is used during
       the ltsp_initialize process to update the gdm.conf file.
       It wasn't handling 'Enable=false', it was only looking 
       for 'Enable=0'.  It is fixed now to handle either case.

     o Added /mnt to root directory as a symlink to /tmp/mnt,
       which will be created on the ramdisk as rc.local runs.

     o Replaced ltsprtd with lp_server. lp_server is from the
       LPRng guys, and it will mimick an HP JetDirect interface.
       Also, made it spawn from inittab.  This way, if it ever
       fails, it will automatically restart.

     o If a serial printer or serial mouse is used, automatically
       load the serial.o kernel module.

     o If a parallel printer is used, then automatically
       load the parallel kernel modules.

     o Added support for Redhat 7.2

     o Added support for Mandrake 8.1

  lts_x_core

     o Updated the /etc/vidlist file.  Robbie found some more entries.

     o Added 'X_VIDEORAM' parameter to the lts.conf file, so you
       can specify the amount of video ram (in kbytes).

     o Changed 'X4_DRIVER_OPTION' to 'X_DEVICE_OPTION', and made it
       work in the rc.setupx3 for X3.3.6 as well.

  lts_kernel

     o Removed the need for ne2k_pci to have an IO arg.  It's a PCI
       card, so PnP will take care of the resource allocation.

     o Added the Linux Progress Patch (LPP).  To enable it, you just
       need to add:

           option option-128  e4:45:74:68:00:00;
           option option-129  "vga=0x301 console=/dev/tty2";

       to the dhcpd.conf file.


Sept 30, 2001 LTSP 2.09pre3 -jam-

  lts_core

     o Preliminary support for Conectiva 7.0.

     o Replaced Busybox version of modprobe with a modprobe
       from Redhat 7.0.  The busybox version wouldn't pay
       attention to the modules.dep file.

     o Moved the NFS swapfiles directory from /opt/ltsp/swapfiles
       to /var/opt/ltsp/swapfiles.  It's variable data, so we put
       it under /var.  Correct, according to the FHS.

     o rc.local will now attempt to automatically detect whether
       to use X3.3.6 or X4.1, based on autodetecting the video
       chipset.

  lts_x_core

     o Added the missing 'XkbLayout' parameter in the rc.setupx
       script.

  lts_kernel

     o The kmods package has been rolled into the kernel package,
       because it is so important that they match.

     o NIC is no automatically detected (PCI only).  You no longer
       need to specify the 'NIC=' parameter in the dhcpd.conf file
       option-128 and option-129.

     o The initrd in the kernel package is now built using uClibc,
       which reduces the size of the tftp download by about 500k.

  ltsp_initialize

     o Completely re-written, to make it much easier to use.
       The user interface will now allow you to move forward
       and backward through the entries, until you get it setup
       the way you want.  You can then APPLY the settings.


Sept 20, 2001 LTSP 2.09pre2-4 -jam-

  lts_core

     o Fixed copying of the ltsp.gif file.  This is the LTSP logo
       that is used for the background on the login screen.

     o Cleaned up the building of the /etc/exports file, needed
       more spaces on one of the lines.

     o Cleaned up the lts.conf file a bit. It had LOCAL_APPS set
       to 'Y'.  That really should default to 'N', so it does now.
       Yes, I had to fix it again, because I didn't do it right in
       pre2-3.

     

Sept 19, 2001 LTSP 2.09pre2-3 -jam-

  lts_core

     o Fixed bug in rc.local.  The code for loading kernel modules
       had a wrong path, causing it to NEVER find the modules.
       Now, if you want to load the agpgart.o module, you specify it
       with this:

           MODULE_01 = kernel/drivers/char/agp/agpgart.o

     o If you had LOCAL_APPS set to 'Y', but hadn't installed the
       local apps package, it would fail when it tried to mount the
       /home directory.  Now, if local apps is enabled, but not
       installed, you will get a warning, then local apps will be
       disabled.

     o Cleaned up the lts.conf file a bit.  It had LOCAL_APPS set
       to 'Y'.  That really should default to 'N', so it does now.

  lts_x_core

       Fixed a problem with using XFS with XFree 4.1.
       The XF86Config file being built didn't have 'tcp/' in
       front of the XFS servers IP address.

  lts_kernel

     o Fixed a problem we had with trying to use cards, like the
       NE2000.  This requires pre-loading the 8390.o module, and
       specifying the io base address.  So, if the NIC is
       either a 3c503, hp_plus, hp, ne or ne2k-pci, then the
       8390.o module will automatically be loaded.
       AND, it will require you to pass the IO address in
       the kernel command line.  This is done via option-129.
       For example:

          option option-129  "NIC=ne IO=0x300";

   ltsp_initrd_kit

     o Repackaged to include the fixes described above
       for the lts_kernel package.


Sept 16, 2001 LTSP 2.09pre2 -jam-

  o Moved the ltsp stuff to a more "FHS Friendly" location.
    The workstation root directory was previously in "/tftpboot/lts/ltsroot".
    It is now in "/opt/ltsp/i386".  This change was discussed on the
    FHS mailing list, the LTSP mailing list and the K12ltsp mailing lists,
    and it was determined that although there isn't currently an FHS
    compliant place for NFS shares, /opt/ltsp would be acceptable.
    A subdirectory of 'i386' was chosen, to pave the way for other
    architectures, such as PPC, Mips, StrongArm, etc...

  o A single kernel + initrd (initial ramdisk) is now available.
    This kernel has a filesystem image appended to it, which will
    be temporarily mounted as the root filesystem. Once the ramdisk
    is mounted, the NIC driver module will be loaded, then a dhcp
    query will be done in userspace.  This will properly query the
    DHCP server, to return the host that should be serving the
    NFS root filesystem.  Previously, the NFS root server had to
    be the same as the server providing TFTP.
    The kernel does not yet auto detect which NIC module to load.
    Instead, that is passed as one of the kernel commandline args
    via option-129.  A future enhancement is planned, that will
    automatically detect PCI network cards and load the appropriate
    driver.

  o Added devfs for the /dev directory
    This gets around the problem of the device nodes being
    in a read-only environment.

  o XFree86 4.1 is now the default version of X Windows.
    To use XFree86 4.x, you need to specify 'XFree86' as 
    your XSERVER, and then specify which driver module in
    the X4_DRIVER entry.
    Currently, the following X4 drivers are available:

       apm, ark, ati, atimisc, chips, cirrus,
       cyrix, fbdev, glint, i128, i740, i810, mga,
       neomagic, nv, r128, radeon, rendition, s3virge,
       savage, siliconmotion, sis, tdfx, tga, trident,
       tseng, vesa, vga, vmware

  o Added ability to swap over NFS.
    Kernel patches provided by Claus-Justus Heine allow the
    workstation kernel to use a file on an NFS mounted filesystem
    to be used as a swap file.

    NFS swap can be turned on by setting USE_NFS_SWAP = Y in the
    lts.conf file.

    The swap file will automatically be created, if it doesn't exist.

    The size of the swap file is controlled by SWAPFILE_SIZE, and it
    defaults to 64m.  If you change the size, then the next time the
    workstation boots, the swapfile will automatically be resized.
  

  o Added NFS_SERVER
    Defaults to DEFAULT_SERVER
  
  o Added SWAP_SERVER
    Defaults to NFS_SERVER

  o Added NFS_SWAPDIR

  o Added LTSP_BASEDIR
    Default is /opt/ltsp

  o Added USE_NFS_SWAP
    Defaults to 'N'

  o Added SWAPFILE_SIZE
    Default is 64m

  o Removed UI_MODE from lts.conf.
    User interface mode is now controlled by RUNLEVEL.

  o Removed LOCAL_WM from lts.conf.
    Now, the window manager will still be running on the
    server, but application programs can run on the workstation.

  o Added X_MOUSE_EMULATE3BTN
    Defaults to 'N'.  If 'Y', it will add the entry to the XF86Config
    file to emulate a 3 button mouse by pressing both the left and right
    mouse button at the same time.

  o Added X4_BUSID
    This is currently only used if your workstation is running inside of
    a VMWare virtual session.  VMware has a problem detecting the virtual
    video adapter, so you need to specify 'X4_BUSID = PCI:0:15:0'.

  o Modified getltscfg, to strip quotes from the values.  Then,
    if quotes are needed, they will be added by rc.local or rc.setupx.

  o Major modifications to LOCAL_APPS.  Only the /home directory will
    be mounted.  Trying to mount /bin, /lib and /usr results in too many
    problems, especially when you consider alternative architecture
    workstations and servers.

  o Added RCFILE_01 thru RCFILE_10 entries in the lts.conf file.
    You can specify scripts to run during the workstation boot process.
    The scripts reside in the workstations /etc/rc.d directory, and
    must be executable.

  o Fixed a problem with the shell running on the workstation console.
    Previously, Ctrl-C and Ctrl-\ didn't work.  This is now fixed.  It 
    required a program running between init and the shell, to setup the
    process group id, so that signals from the tty driver would be
    delivered to the shell.

  o You can now specify either a complete modeline, or just
    the desired resolution.  For example:

      X_MODE_0 = 1024x768

            or

      X_MODE_0 = 1024x768 75 1024 1048 1184 1328 768 771 777 806 -hsync -vsync

    Will both work.  The first entry will set the resolution, but use the
    built-in modeline information.  The second entry will completely replace
    the built-in modeline information with the specified modeline.

  o For XFree86 3.3.6:

     - Added lots of default modeline entries.  Resolutions from
       640x480 through 1800x1440 are now supported.


06/07/2001 -jam-

  o  Changed release to 2.08

  o  Added 'X_MOUSE_EMULATE3BTN' option in lts.conf for 3-button
     mouse emulation.

  o  Added xkbcomp to the ltsroot/bin directory.  It was missing in
     the pre2 release, causing the BACKSPACE key to not work properly.

  o  Added libnss_dns-2.2.so and libresolv-2.2.so so that local apps
     could resolve dns.
  
05/08/2001 -jam-

  o  Changed release to 2.08pre2

  o  Copied the lts.conf.readme file back to the etc directory.
     It was there in 2.07, but somehow didn't make it into 2.08pre1.

  o  ltsbin and bin were included in the package twice.  Removed the
     extra copies.

  o  Took the X11R6/lib/modules directory out.  This is primarily for
     additional X functionality, such as TouchScreens and digitizer pads.
     The modules will become part of a new package.

  o  Upgraded to BusyBox 0.51.

  o  Directory structure changed for the BusyBox commands.  There is
     now a /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin and /usr/sbin directory and the commands
     are distributed amongst those directories.

  o  Added new feature to the Telnet included with BusyBox.  It will
     now pass the terminal type to the remote host.  This patch has
     been submitted to (and accepted by) the BusyBox people.

  o  Modified the way the runlevels work within etc/inittab.
     You can now specify different runlevels for each workstation.
     In the past, you would specify the 'initdefault' entry in the
     inittab file.  Now, that entry should always be '2', and you specify
     which runlevel you want in the lts.conf file.  The new setting
     is called 'RUNLEVEL'.  If it isn't present in the lts.conf file, it
     will default to '5', for a GUI workstation.  Other possible values
     are:  '3' - Shell on the console of the workstation.  '4' Telnet
     session(s) to a remote host.

  o  Multiple telnet sessions to a remote host are now supported.
     Set 'RUNLEVEL' to '4' to enable the telnet sessions.  Set
     'TELNET_SESSIONS' to the number of sessions you want.  The default
     is 2.

  o  Moved the 'get_cfg' function out of the rc.local script and into
     a file called 'etc/ltsp_functions' to be source'd into rc.local
     and other scripts.

  o  Modified the install scripts to check for the existence of the
     /etc/X11/xdm, /etc/X11/gdm and /etc/X11/kdm directories before
     trying to configure those display managers.

  o  Modified install scripts for Redhat 7.1 and Mandrake 8.0 to set
     command line options for syslogd in the /etc/sysconfig/syslog file.

  o  Reduced size of this distribution from roughly 18mb down to 12mb.

04/24/2001 -jam-

  o  Changed release to 2.08pre1

  o  Fixed bug in install.sh where it was looking for 'debian-version'
     instead of 'debian_version'  (Notice the dash vs. underscore)

  o  Changed distribution to include a mostly complete ltsroot directory
     complete with libraries and binaries.  It was just getting too
     messy, trying to steal those files from the host.

  o  New support for RedHat 7.1

  o  New support for Mandrake 8.0

01/16/2001 -jam

  o  Changed release to 2.07

  o  Modifed install_functions.sh.  The copy_file function now
     checks to make sure the source file exists before copying it.

  o  Added support for Caldera eServer v2.3 and eDesktop v2.3 & v2.4.

01/13/2001 -jam

  o  Changed release to 2.06

  o  In inittab, changed '-noclear' to '--noclear'

  o  In inittab, changed '--login' to '-login' on the 'sh' lines.

  o  In redhat.sh and mandrake.sh, fixed the creation of the inetd
     and Xservers templates.  They were being created with a '.sh'
     suffix but they need to have '.tmpl' suffix in order for
     ltsp_initialize to use them.

  o  Removed the xsri program from the distribution.  Redhat systems
     should already have this.  For others, we will make it separately
     available.

  o  in ltsroot/etc/profile.  Changed 'PS1' prompt variable to NOT
     include the user's name when in shell mode.  This is because the
     workstation doesn't know who the user is.

01/02/2001 -jam-

  o  Integrated port for Mandrake 7.2 supplied by Eric Seigne <erics@rycks.com>

  o  Fixed problem with gdm.  It was not setting the background and
     ltsp logo because it couldn't execute the Xsetup_workstation
     script.  It requires the first line to be '#!/bin/sh'.

  o  Added missing quote to rc.setupx in the Screen->accell section.
     (Thanks to David Rose!)

  o  Fixed a problem with ltsprtd.  It was opening the printer with
     O_NONBLOCK set and that was causing output to be truncated on
     serial printers.

  o  Added a default 'SERVER' entry to the lts.conf file.  This has
     always been available, but hidden within the rc.local script.
     Other variables were depending on it, such as TELNET_HOST.
     It usually wasn't a problem unless you wanted to change the
     network addresses.  People would usually change XDM_SERVER and
     SYSLOG_HOST, but they would forget (or not know) to change
     the value of SERVER.  Then the telnet program wouldn't work
     properly.

  o  Added lts.conf.readme file to the /tftpboot/lts/ltsroot/etc
     directory.  This is a documentation file showing available
     parameters for the lts.conf file.

  o  Added Georg's logfile change to redhat.sh and mandrake.sh.

  o  Changed the inittab file to include '--login' on the /bin/sh lines
     so that the /etc/profile or ~/.profile will get read (if it exists).

  o  Added readlink() function to redhat.sh because I found that
     the readlink program is not guaranteed to be installed on Redhat 7.0.

  o  Added code to the tftp.tmpl script to enable tftp on Redhat 7.0 and
     Mandrake 7.2.  They use xinetd and I used chkconfig to enable the
     service.

12/31/2000 -georg-

  o  Fixed some grammer errors in suse.sh and added preliminary support
     for Suse 7.1 beta.

  o  Fixed problem with the building of the dhcpd.conf.example file.
     It was appending to the file rather than creating a completely
     new file.

  o  debian.sh was checking for tftp and spitting out the line it matched.
     All we really cared about was whether a match was found.  Fixed it
     by redirecting the output to /dev/null.

  o  Fixed problem with the creation of the install logfile in suse.sh 
     and debian.sh. The logfile was created from install.sh, and then the 
     distro scripts created a new one rather than appending to the existing 
     one, because the variable LOGINIT was not set to "Y" for the 
     logit() function.

11/19/2000 -Georg-

  o  After 2 weeks of beta status and only 1 bug found,
     I'm upgrading the package to 'Stable'.

  o  Fixed problem with /tftpboot path in inetd.conf.

11/05/2000 -jam-

  o  Released lts_core-2.04pre1.

  o  syslog fixed on the workstations.  There was a problem with syslog
     running on the workstations.  It wouldn't actually send any
     syslog messages from daemons on the workstation.  This was a problem
     found and fixed by Ron Colcernian <rcc@Dresults.com>.  It required
     creating a symbolic link for /dev/log to point into the /tmp directory.

  o  Changed rc.local to mount the /proc filesystem before creating
     the ramdisk for /tmp.  This way, when the ramdisk is mounted,
     the mount command won't complain about not being able to 
     determine if it is already mounted.

11/03/2000 -stephan-

  o  changed all default settings in debian.sh, suse.sh and redhat.sh to
     "Y" (excluding the bootp stuff)

  o  suse.sh 
     - fixed two minor bugs (wrong filename Xaccess.sh and bad regexp 
       for changing NFS_SERVER in rc.config)

  o  changed file extensions for the templates to .tmpl

  o  added some code to ltsp_initialize to detect the template type

11/03/2000 -georg-

  o  etc/rc.local
     - added /var/X11R6/xkb/compiled symlink for older SuSE Xservers
    
  o  install.sh
     - fixed tests for empty strings: -n ${a} does not work, use -n "${a}"
     - added libnss_files.so.1 for systems with glibc 2.0

11/02/2000 -stephan-

  o  ltsp_initialize 0.4b
     - Georg found some bugs... (only bugfixing)

  o  added the root-path option in the dhcp.conf.examples

  o  suse.sh
     - basic support for xdm logins is working (v. 0.01a)

  o  porting_guide.txt
     - added one line (the templates must end with .sh or .pl)

11/01/2000 -georg-

  o  etc/rc.local
     - readded ode to search for XF86Config also in /etc/X11
       when did this get lost?

  o  install.sh
     - fixed the symlink for /usr/X11R6/xkb/compiled
     - fixed the libs for the Debian xserver, hopefully the last time:-)

  o  debian.sh
     - removed all killalls, they did not work. The sysadmin has to reload
       daemons by hand
 
  o  CONFIG
     - made comment clearer

  o  INSTALL
     - added some text regarding Debian and CONFIG

  o  porting_guide.txt
     - added some text

  o  redhat.sh
     - fixed the code for /etc/X11/gdm/Init/Default. Jim, could you
       test if this works?

10/31/2000 -stephan-

  o  gdm_change.pl
     - added some comments

  o  ltsp_initialize (ver 0.4)
     - added new "function" BACKUP_FILE... will be described in
       some docu (sometimes ;-) )
     - minor bugfixes and changes

  o  install.sh (Georg made a lot of changes...)
     - checking for existing distro-scripts
     - added new test for root user (id -u) TODO: test on red hat
     - new filenames for the distro scripts
     - removed the hack for the xserver libs, added instead libz to
       the list of hardcoded libs
     - is the creation of $LTSROOT/tmp/hosts really necessary??
    
  o  CONFIG
     - Renamed IP_NETWORK_0 to IP_NETWORK_BASE
     - removed the TARGET variables

  o  redhat.sh (Georg made some bugfixes)
     - removed hardcoded ltsroot paths
     - removed unused XDM variable
     - cleaned up the comments
     - added a missing subshell >> $TARGET
     - does Red hat provide an update-inetd command?
    
  o  debian.sh (Georg wrote a lot of great stuff :-) )
     - removed TARGET_ and SOURCE_ variables
     - now sets up every dm for which the config files can be found
     - removed hardcoded ltsroot paths
     - added a missing subshell >> $TARGET
     - creates now only a startup link for *dm when none is already there
     - backported Jims changes from redhat.sh
        
  o  suse.sh (Don´t ask me! By the time I didn´t find the
     time to test it and it´s really more trivial and more
     stupid then the others. sorry!)

10/29/2000 -jam-

  I started with the install-2.04.sh script that Georg Baum provided
  me.  He had modified it to handle Debian and SuSE.  I then went through
  it to make sure it would still work with redhat.

  Here are the changes that I made:

  o  When testing redhat-release, simplified the awk command.
     the "-F ' '" option isn't necessary.

  o  Cleaned up the comment in the Debian release testing, to
     make it easier to read.

  o  Cleaned up some spelling in some of the comments.

  o  Changed variable names with 'DISTRIBUTION' to 'DISTRO'.  It's
     shorter and still informative enough.

  o  Changed name of 'install.conf' to 'CONFIG' to make it more
     like other projects I've seen.

  o  In CONFIG file, changed VERSION from '2.0' to '2.04'.

  o  Took backup_file() out of install.functions

  o  In install.sh script, where it sets up the 
     ${ROOT_DIR}/etc/version file, I changed it to use the
     ${VERSION} variable instead of the hardcoded '2.0'.

  o  SecurityPolicy.  Some distros put the file in /etc/X11/xserver
     while others put it in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xserver.  Some, like
     RH7.0 put it in /etc/X11/xserver and then create a symlink so
     if the Xserver is looking for SecurityPolicy in the
     /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xserver directory, it will find it through
     the symlink.
     The install script will now put the SecurityPolicy file in
     /etc/X11/xserver and then create the symlink in the other directory
     so that any Xserver should be able to find the file.

  o  Changed the creation of the symlink for xkb/compiled to use
     the make_symlink function.

  o  Changed copying of mke2fs, ifconfig, mount and syslogd to use
     upper case 'FULLNAME' instead of lowercase.  More consistent with
     other variable usage.
     
  o  Changed install_template_redhat to automatically setup all of
     the display managers (xdm, kdm, gdm) rather than trying to figure
     out which one is currently being used.  This way, the sysadmin
     is free to change the display manager at a later time and ltsp will
     continue to function. 

  o  In the install_template_redhat script, I changed the variable
     'XDM_RUNNING' to 'DM_RUNNING' so that it doesn't imply the
     actual 'xdm'.

  o  Changed the install_template_redhat script to use the chkconfig
     command to create the symlinks for the services in runlevel 5,
     rather than creating the symlinks manually.

  o  Changed getltscfg and ltsprtd to be executable so that ldd would
     be able to check for shared libs.

  o  Changed the redhat template file to produce templates that have
     a '.sh' suffix

  o  Modified Stephan's ltsp_initialize script to look for *.sh in 
     the templates directory.

  o  Fixed path to telnet in the rc.local script.  It was looking for
     telnet in /usr/bin, but it is part of busybox and placed in /bin.

10/23/2000 - stephan
10/21/2000 - Georg Baum <Georg.baum@gmx.de>

  o  changed path function name "create_template" to backup_file

  o  changed path name "templates" to config_scripts (here in the core package,
     not in /tftpboot/...) (stephan)

  o  added demo ltsp_initialize.pl (stephan) 

  o  Fixed some typos in install-2.04.sh (georg)

  o  readded one hardcoded library  (georg)

  o  improved the library detection code (now it really copies each lib
     only once) (georg)

  o  new function record_libs in install_functions.sh (georg)

  o  some changes in install-2.04.sh to make it work with Debian, especially
     in line 383 the file hosts is now really created in $ROOT_DIR/tmp and not
     in /tmp. How did this work before???  (georg)

  o  reverted my silly change about the xkb/compiled symlink (georg)

  o  rc.local: XF86Config is now also searched in /etc/X11 (georg)

10/13/2000 - Stephan Lauffer

  o  Fixing some minor bugs

  o  Moving SOURCE_* variables from install.conf to install_templates_*

  o  Adding some code to install-2.04.sh to find some paths (gtk, CORBA)

Changes from 2.04pre (was test-0) to 2.04-test1 
  o  Georg added some code to install-2.04.sh so that it detect the necessary
     libs by itself (while installing).

Changes from 2.03 to 2.04pre (was test-0)
  o  Stephan has splitted install.sh in different file
       install-2.04.sh
       install.conf
       install_functions.sh
       install_templates_redhat-6.2.sh
       install_templates_redhat-7.0.sh
       templates/Xaccess.sh
       templates/Xservers.sh
       templates/Xsetup_workstation.sh
       templates/bootptab.sh
       templates/dhcp.sh
       templates/exports.sh
       templates/hosts_allow.sh
       templates/inetd.sh
       templates/inittab.sh
       templates/ltsp_logo.sh
       templates/nfs.sh
       templates/portmap.sh
       templates/syslog.sh
  
08/14/2000 -jam-

  o  Fixed path to telnet in the rc.local script and changed install.sh
     to copy the telnet binary from the host system into the ${LTSROOT}/bin
     directory.

Changes to LTS from version 2.02 to 2.03

  o  Fixed a problem with the RPM.  The 2.02 rpm was still referring to
     the 2.01 tarball.  Now, it's been updated to use 2.03 properly.

  o  Fixed problem with permissions on the LTSP_DIR in install.sh.
     Thanks to Georg Baum for the fix.

  o  Fixed problem with printers in the rc.local script.  I was
     Setting PRT_0, PRT_1 and PRT_2 but then I was checking
     PRT_1, PRT_2 and PRT_3.  Thanks to Stephan Lauffer for the fix.

Changes to LTS from version 2.0 to 2.02

  o  Installation procedure has been changed to allow you to review the
     changes that it will make to the system files.  It puts the
     templates in the /tftpboot/lts/templates directory, where you
     can review them, and run the ltsp_initialize script to apply the
     changes.

  o  New variables for lts.conf:

       NIS_SERVER     Set this to the IP address of your NIS server if you
                      don't want it to send a broadcast looking for one.
       SEARCH_DOMAIN  Used in the /etc/resolv.conf
       DNS_SERVER     Used in the /etc/resolv.conf

  o  Fixed a problem with creating the yp/nicknames file, it head a bunch
     of leading spaces on each line.  Apparently NIS doesn't like that.

  o  When editing the inetd.conf file, changed the sed command to allow
     white-space to exist between the '#' and the 'tftp'.

  o  Fixed the problem with the size of the ramdisk that will be created.
     It was incorrectly getting set to 4096kb but the kernels were compiled
     with 1024kb built in.  I changed the size in rc.local to 1024kb.

  o  Install script does a better job of finding the shared libs, thanks
     to help from Stephan Lauffer (lauffer@ph-freiburg.de)

  o  A statically linked bash shell is now placed in /tftpboot/lts/ltsroot/bin
     This makes it easier to debug the setup.

  o  Added /opt as one of the directories that gets exported for the workstation
     to mount when in Local-Apps mode.

  o  yp.conf is now a symlink to a file in /tmp, so that config entries can be
     written there during the boot process.  Namely the 'NIS_SERVER' entry
     can be configured.

  o  /etc/mtab is now a symlink to /proc/mounts.  This causes a warning during
     bootup when the ramdisk is mounted, we still need to figure that out.
   
Changes to LTS from version 1.03 and 1.92 to 2.0

  o  LTSP v1.92 was a development release that added support for Local apps.
     This new release contains that and everything from v1.03.

  o  Distribution in both RPM's and TGZ's.

  o  The distribution is not much smaller.  It pulls most of the binaries
     and libraries from the host machine it is being installed on.

  o  Many new configuration variables have been added the lts.conf file
     to help in configuring XFree86.

  o  Loadable kernel modules are now supported, with new configuration
     entries in the lts.conf file.

  o  The XF86Config file is still built automatically while the workstation
     boots, but the generation of the file is now handled in a new script
     called rc.setupx which is called by rc.local.  Separating the generation
     of the XF86Config file from the rest of the boot-time configuration
     should make it easier to customize the generation of the XF86Config file.

  o  Support for EloTouch touchscreens has been added.  It should be easy
     to add support for additional touchscreens as they become available
     to us.

  o  The Xservers are now placed in the /tftpboot/lts/ltsroot/ltsbin directory
     because if LOCAL_APPS is enabled, the /usr filesystem is mounted via NFS
     overlaying the current usr directory.

  o  BusyBox has been added to give a more complete runtime environment.
     BusyBox is a single binary that contains many popular Linux/Unix commands.
     See the BusyBox homepage at http://busybox.lineo.com for more info.

  o  The installation script is now much more thorough at setting up
     the server.  It will automatically modify most all of the system
     files necessary to permit a diskless client to boot from the server.

  o  An example dhcpd.conf file is now placed in /etc/dhcpd.conf.examples
     to make it easier to get DHCP working.

  o  Much better support for Internation keyboards.  New config entries
     have been created in the lts.conf file.
     The config variables have been added, but we could use some help
     in determining the exact values to use for the various international
     setups.

  o  The default size of the ramdisk has been reduced to 1mb and it is
     configurable with a new entry in the lts.conf file.

  o  If you want to create your own custom XF86Config file, you can use
     it by placing it in the /tftpboot/lts/ltsroot/etc directory with
     a unique name, then pointing to that file with an entry in the
     lts.conf file.

  o  Added a new UI_MODE of 'SHELL' to execute a shell on the workstation


Changes to LTS from version 1.02 to 1.03

  o  Fixed problem with permissions on rc.local.  Version 1.02 was setting
     the permissions to NOT include executable.  Leaving the workstation unable
     to boot.

  o  Correctly removed the requirement of bootp.  It was documented in the
     previous release that bootp was no longer required, but the rpm was
     still requiring it.

Changes to LTS from version 1.01 to 1.02

  o  Added support for DHCP.  This requires that the kernel is tagged with
     the name of the directory to mount as it's root filesystem.  new versions
     of the kernels are available on the LTSP web and ftp sites.  Also, instructions
     have been added to the LTSP documentation, showing how to create your own
     kernels.

  o  Added printer support.  The LTSP Printer daemon (ltsprtd) has been
     written.  This is based on Ken Yap's p910nd, but support has been added
     for serial printers, and several command line options have been added.
     Upto 3 printers can be setup per workstation.

  o  Printers can now be created and modified using a modified version of
     Redhat's Printtool program.  Either the complete Printtool program, or
     patches that can be applied to the existing Printtool program MUST be
     downloaded from the LTSP web or ftp servers.

Changes to LTS from version 1.0 to 1.01

  o  Support for Redhat 6.1.

  o  Changed the name of the workstation startup script
     from '/tmp/startx' to '/tmp/start_ws'.  The name 'startx' could cause some
     confusion with the 'startx' script that brings up X on most systems.

  o  Installation no longer modifies the /etc/X11/xdm/Xservers file.  Previous
     versions would comment out the line for the local X server.  This would
     prevent the server from bringing up X-Windows when the server boots.

  o  Added Character based mode.  A new lts.conf configuration item called
     'UI_MODE' has been added.  It can have a value of either 'GUI' or 'CHAR'.
     The default is 'GUI'.  This is used in the rc.local script when building
     the 'start_ws' script.  If 'CHAR' is chosen, then telnet will be invoked
     with the value of the 'TELNET_HOST' configuration entry passed as the
     address of the host to log into.

  o  Added the ability to NOT use XFS.  A new lts.conf configuration item
     called 'USE_XFS' has been added.  It can have a value 'Y' or 'N'.  
     The default is 'N'.  This will cause X to access the fonts from
     the '/tftpboot/lts/ltsroot/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/' directory.  This was
     changed because there were some problems using XFS to serve fonts to lots
     of workstations.

     XFS can be tuned to handle more workstations.  Take a look at the
     manpage on XFS for more info, and see the XFS config file, which is
     normally '/etc/X11/fs/config'.

  o  Added 'telnet   23/tcp' to the etc/services file to support running telnet
     in character mode.

  o  Fixed the DefaultColorDepth entry in the generation of the XF86Config file.
     It has been changed to 'Depth'.  The DefaultColorDepth entry was invalid,
     and was being ignored.

  o  The following configuration entries have been added to allow setting of
     X screen blanking:
        X_BLANKTIME    sets 'BlankTime'    Default =  5 minutes.
        X_SUSPENDTIME  sets 'SuspendTime'  Default = 10 minutes.
        X_OFFTIME      sets 'OffTime'      Default = 30 minutes.

     Take a look at the manpage on XF86Config for more information on these
     settings.

  o  Lots of cleanup and changes to the documentation.  Including a greatly
     expanded troubleshooting section.

  o  Separate troubleshooting guide, so you won't have to print the entire
     document.

  o  Information about tuning the server to handle the load when lots of
     workstations are added.

  o  Information about using LTSP with other distributions of Linux, and with
     SCO OpenServer 5.0.5.

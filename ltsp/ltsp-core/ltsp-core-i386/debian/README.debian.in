ltsp-core-i386 for DEBIAN
----------------------

Be sure to adjust /etc/dhcpd.conf, /etc/exports and 
_ROOT_DIR_/etc/lts.conf before trying to boot a client,
especially the IP-address of the server.
You either have to install the ltsp-kernel-i386 package too,
or you have to build your own tagged kernel image and install it
under _LTSP_DIR_.
If you want to use the clients as X-Terminals, you need to install
the lts-x-core-i386 package and maybe an ltsp-xserver package.
See the installation guide in the ltsp-doc package or at
http://www.ltsp.org/documentation/ for details.

I think that this package complies now to the Debian Policy,
with the following exceptions:
a) It installs under /opt. Since it is not part of the official Debian,
   it is allowed to do so (/opt is for "add-on" packages).
b) It has configuration files in _ROOT_DIR_/etc. This is because they
   must be accessible by the clients and thus cannot reside in /etc.
c) Because there are no real source packages it must go to non-free.

There might be missing package dependencies, so if something does not
work because you have not installed a certain package, please report it to me.

The script _TMPL_DIR_/ltsp_initialize can be used 
to configure the package and change some system configuration files. See
_TMPL_DIR_/README for Details.
To generate the templates that are used by this script from your current
system configuration, use 
_TMPL_DIR_/create-templates/create-templates.sh.

Description: Linux Terminal Server Project (ltsp.org)
 This package will setup the environment needed for booting diskless
 GNU/Linux workstations (currently x86 architecture only) from a server.
 It includes a complete root filesystem for running the clients
 in text mode.
 .
 Additionally you need to make your diskless PC booting over the network.
 This can be done with the netboot package or with etherboot
 (http://etherboot.sourceforge.net). On the server you need also a tagged 
 linux-kernel image. You could either install the ltsp-kernel-i386
 package or build your own image with the utilities provided by netboot
 and etherboot.

This module contains everything that is needed for building the Debian packages
of LTSP out of the binary .tgz packages. It does only exist because LTSP does not use
CVS right now and I want to keep the debian things in CVS.
This module might be folded into the main LTSP CVS and disappear from here once
the LTSP CVS is set up.

The contents of this module is not useful for you unless you want to experiment
with building your own LTSP .debs.

In order to build the whole thing, you have to do this:


./get_packages

Then unpack the files in the packages directory into the appropriate
directories (unpack_packages won´t work, it expects .dsc and .diff.gz files). 

Then:

pushd ltsp-x-server
./make.xservers
oopd
./make.lts


Please don´t forget to add a changelog entry if you did any local modifications
so that the package management does not get confused.


More documentation is not available, since the building scripts are primaryly intended
for my own personal use. Look at the scripts if you want to understand more.
